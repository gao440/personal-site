Nice to meet you I'm Charles. I am someone who is passionate about storytelling, understanding, product development, and learning. In the future I hope to develop myself and help others along the way!\n\n# Me\nAs a child, I grew up adoring many of the great silicon valley tech founders (Tony Hsieh, Brian Chesky, Evan Spiegel, Peter Thiel, Johns & Patrick Collison, and Sam Altman). To be honest, at first, I may have been drawn to the glitz and glamour that these founders had. But my reason for being interested in them quickly changed as I started to read and watch hours of their lectures and talks done at Techcrunch, Stanford, and YC. As I learned more about them, I grew more to love their abilities to create and change the world around them more than anything else.\\\n\\\nI was a lazy child. I never really did anything out of my way to create and build the things I was passionate about. It sometimes haunts me sometimes that I never acted on my passion for creation but now as a young adult I won't let my laziness or fears stop me from acting on my passions.\\\n\\\nI am an aspiring founder, software engineer, product manager hoping to create a difference.\n- I grew up in Northville, Michigan, a suburb of Detriot (Go lions!) \n- I love the sun\n- I feel in rediscovered my love for products and the devlopment at a 3 day techstars startup event my sophomore year of college\n- I love going to hackathons and trying to make stuff even if it fails.\n- I grew up playing tennis so I'm a litte competitive\n- I am allergic to cats\n- I have read the Percy Jackson series over 5 times\n- When I was a freshman in highschool I used a 20 visa-prepaid card to buy a year long subscription to Entrepreneur Magazine (I only read the first 2 issues and skimed the rest)\n\nAsk me anything in person I would love to share stories!\n\n- As a Gen Z I was raised on the internet here of some of my favorite youtubers and or websites!!\n([Nathaniel Drew](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrdWRLq10OHuy7HmSckV3Vg) , [Matt D'Avella](https://www.youtube.com/user/blackboxfilmcompany), [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/user/Sepharoth64), [Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/user/99baddawg), [Elliot Choy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaQocIkdhh8TIi56LvLoViA), [TechLead](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xKdmAXFh4ACyhpiQ_3qBw))\n\n# I like and do in my free time\n\n- [Running](https://www.strava.com/)\n- Writing\n- DND\n- Start-ups\n- [Books (goodreads)](https://www.goodreads.com/charlesgao)\n- Reading\n- Podcasts (The GaryVee Audio Experience, Reply All, Startup Podcast, The Pitch and others)\n- [Good design](/)\n- Photography\n- Youtube(Nathaniel Drew, Matt D'Avella, Ali Abdaal, Ben Awad)\n- Games (Valorant, Overwatch, Apex Legends and more)\n- Tiktok(Yes, Yes I do waste some time on here but there are some great Software and Product Manager learning opportunties on Tiktok, [Cherie Luo](https://www.tiktok.com/@cherie.brooke?lang=en) [Productgal](ttps://www.tiktok.com/@productgal?lang=en))\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- My favorite book I read in 2020 was \"The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter--And How to Make the Most of Them Now\"\n- I want to think about thinking more, Metacognition, books allow me to do this sometimes.\n- I love thrifting for clothes, it feels great to find hidden gems\n- I want to one day run the Iron Man Triathalon \n\n# I dream of\n\n- exploring the world\n- learning how to communicate better\n- meeting new people\n- (I know this is corny) Changing the world\n\n# Some People I admire (Some are websites, some are linkedin links)\n- [Tim Ferris](https://tim.blog/)\n- [Markell Baldwin](http://markellbaldwin.com/)\n- [Allison Chang](https://www.allisonc.design/about)\n- [Dr. Avinash Kak](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/)\n- [Yi Jinho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jinho-yi-66bb1116a/)\n- [Cherie Luo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cherie-luo/)\n- [ProductGal](https://www.tiktok.com/@productgal?lang=en)\n",d=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,c=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(h.jsx)(a.b,Object(o.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(h.jsx)(s.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Charles Gao",children:Object(h.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(h.jsx)("header",{children:Object(h.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(h.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(h.jsx)(a.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(h.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{source:l,renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
